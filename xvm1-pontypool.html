The zombie horror genre is an over-saturated one; and it takes something truly original to remind you why you loved them in the first place. "Pontypool" is such a movie. The atmosphere of Pontypool -- in a church basement that serves as a broadcast studio for Pontypool"s only radio station -- is very effective for building the suspense and fear factor of this movie.

I just remember after I finished watching it, thinking, I have no idea what I just watched but I think I love it!

Such an interesting take on zombies, well done film that is unique and original! I for sure understand how some hate it though. See Tweets about #Pontypool on Twitter.

I rewatched it tonight and forgot how great it is. I think it’s great how them being live on air really amps up the tension and gives it a sense of urgency. In a lot of horror films the characters are experiencing the action or the main conflict very directly, so it’s really a great way of flipping that on its head by unfolding the story from a point of view that is very limited. They took full advantage of that I think and created an atmosphere full of paranoia and panic which works Pontypool Coleg Gwent, Pontypool. 205 likes · 468 were here. College & University.

I was playing MGSV TPP and I was extracting wandering Mother Base Soldiers and I got a notification that one of my men were given a medal. I also then got told that some shit was going down in quarantine and then I did Mission 43. That mission really hit me hard.
